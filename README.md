# JANKENPON

Jankenpon is Japanese for "paper, scissors, rock")

This project was part of an introductory programming course at Udacity. 

## HOW TO PLAY
One player choses paper, scissors or rock the other player, too. Paper beats rock, scissors beat paper, and rock beats scissors. If both choices are of the same kind eg. "rock vs. rock" it is a tie. After three rounds, the  player who has beaten the opponent the most is the winner. 

## HINTS
There are five kinds of strategies your opponent may use:
a. playing randomly; b. imitating your last move eg. if you chose "paper" at round 1, he will play "paper" at round 2.; c. using all of the three options once; d. always choosing "rock"; e. thinking that you are going to repeat your last move eg. if you chose "paper" at round 1, he will play "scissors" at round 2. But sometimes he has just bad luck and loses all rounds. Discover the strategy your opponent is using to raise your chances of winning! By the way, the same player may use different strategies at different matches. And no, Bart does not always play "rock".
